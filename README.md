 This project was written for using the [YoloV5 object detection model](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to identify objects in an image. 
 
 The frontend was written in React.JS with Material UI componenets. Its purpose was to send images supplied by the user to the backend server. 
 The backend was written in Python with Flask and it would process the uploaded images through the YoloV5 model and return a modified image with the different objects identified in the image. 
        

Server side backend code is in `python_app` folder

Front-end UI in `material_app` folder

#  About Dori.AI
DoriAI provides the PLATFORM to train and deploy models using given data to automate certain processes
        - For example: In an Amazon warehouse where workers are required to wear masks, camera systems can use AI models built using Dori to detect when a worker isnâ€™t wearing a mask and flags the respective manager to take action (or something like that)
